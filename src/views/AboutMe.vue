            <strong class="text-highlight">Currently</strong> I am working remotely for a company in North Carolina so I spend my days writing
            code, sipping coffee and bending to the will of my three furry cats. A few years ago I found
            myself looking for a career change so I decided to give programming a try and Iâ€™ve been
            hooked ever since.

        <p>
            I've spent a little bit of time exploring PHP, Laravel and MYSQL, but most recently I have
            been digging deep into Javascript and Vue.js. I have completed projects using both languages
            and frameworks and I am currently working on the front end of a project built with Vue.js.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            In my spare time I love to travel with my husband and fellow developer Des, spend time with
            my family or try out some new recipes.
        </p><br>

        <p> I am currently located in Billings, MT but I'd love to hear from you! so if you are too I am available in person. Otherwise
            you can reach me on Skype, FaceTime or by phone or email.
        </p><br>

            about my work.
