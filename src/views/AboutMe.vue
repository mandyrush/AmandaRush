        </p>

        <p>
        I am a self proclaimed writer, traveler, artist, herder of cats and of course a code junkie. I spend my days
        sipping coffee, writing code and bending to the will of my three furry felines. In my spare time I love to go
        on adventures with my husband and fellow developer Des, try out a new climbing wall or grab a drink with friends.

        A few years ago I found myself looking for a career change so I decided to give programming a try and I’ve
        been hooked ever since. Currently I am working remotely for a company in North Carolina on the front end of
        a redesign project. As it nears completion I am excited to explore new opportunities where I can continue to
        learn and grow.
        </p>

        <p>
        I got my feet wet learning a little about PHP, Laravel and MYSQL and put them to use building my first project,
        <a href="http://catswander.com/" target="_blank" class="project-title link">catswander.com</a>. As my learning
        continued I became interested in Javascript so I switched gears and have been focusing on that ever since. I
        chose Vue.js as my JS framework of choice as it integrates nicely with Laravel which I was already familiar
        with. I have completed projects using both languages and frameworks and the front end of my current project is
        a SPA built with Vue.js and Vuex.
        </p>

        <p>
        I love to learn and make a point each day to set aside a little time dedicated to tackling new concepts. I
        welcome any challenges and look forward to beginning my next projects.

        My husband and I live in Billings, MT but we are open to the possibility of relocation. Please check out my
        links above and feel free to send me a message if you would like to talk more about my work. I can also be
        reached on Skype or by phone or email. I'd love to hear from you!
