                    <strong class="text-highlight">Greetings!</strong> My name is Amanda. I am a
                    front end web developer with a passion for technology, learning new things and building
                    cool stuff.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Currently I am working remotely for a company in North Carolina so I spend my days writing
                    code, sipping coffee and bending to the will of my three furry cats. A few years ago I found
                    myself looking for a career change so I decided to give programming a try and Iâ€™ve been
                    hooked ever since.

                    I've spent a little bit of time exploring PHP, Laravel and MYSQL, but most recently I have
                    been digging deep into Javascript and Vue.js. I have completed projects using both languages
                    and frameworks and I am currently working on the front end of a project built with Vue.js.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    In my spare time I love to travel with my husband and fellow developer Des, spend time with
                    my family or try out some new recipes.
