            <strong class="text-highlight">Greetings!</strong> My name is Amanda. I am a
            front end web developer with a passion for technology, learning new things and building
            cool stuff.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Currently I am working remotely for a company in North Carolina so I spend my days writing
            code, sipping coffee and bending to the will of my three furry cats. A few years ago I found
            myself looking for a career change so I decided to give programming a try and Iâ€™ve been
            hooked ever since.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            I've spent a little bit of time exploring PHP, Laravel and MYSQL, but most recently I have
            been digging deep into Javascript and Vue.js. I have completed projects using both languages
            and frameworks and I am currently working on the front end of a project built with Vue.js.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            In my spare time I love to travel with my husband and fellow developer Des, spend time with
            my family or try out some new recipes.
        </p>
