      Greetings!"My name is Amanda.I am a front-end web developer with a passion
      for technology, learning and creating. My main focus is on Javascript,
      React, Vue, HTML5 and CSS3. I also have experience with Laravel and PHP."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="text-highlight">I am a</strong> self proclaimed writer,
      traveler, artist, herder of cats and of course web developer. I spend my
      days sipping coffee, writing code and bending to the will of my three
      furry felines. In my spare time I love to go on adventures with my husband
      and fellow developer Des, try out a new climbing wall or grab a drink with
      friends.

    <p>
      <strong class="text-highlight">A few years ago</strong> I found myself
      looking for a career change so I decided to give programming a try and
      Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since. Until recently I worked remotely for a
      company in North Carolina on the front end of a redesign project. Now that
      my share of the project has come to completion, I am excited to explore
      new opportunities where I can continue to learn and grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="text-highlight">I got my feet wet</strong> learning a
      little about PHP, Laravel and MYSQL and put them to use building my first
      project,
      <a
        href="http://catswander.com/"
        target="_blank"
        class="project-title link"
        >catswander.com</a
      >. As my learning continued I became interested in Javascript so I
      switched gears and have been focusing on that ever since. I took several
      courses on Vue, Vuex, React and Redux. I have completed projects using
      both frameworks and the front end of my most recent project was a SPA
      using Vue and Vuex. Currently I am diving into Node and Express to learn
      how to build RESTFUL API's for a new project I am working on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="text-highlight">I love to learn</strong> and make a point
      each day to set aside a little time dedicated to tackling new concepts. I
      welcome any challenges and look forward to beginning my next projects.
